        <h1 class="heading">Helping others is an action of kindness and humanity</h1>
        <p class="first">Helping others is an action of kindness and humanity that spreads happiness to everyone in this world. Some people help others get help when they are stuck in a problem, and some help others as they want to have positive vibes in their lives.
            When you help others, your intention should be good; when you help others, do not wait for a thank you from them. Actions speak more than words; people give a speech to the world, but rather than speaking, one should help others in this world. Even small acts also play a significant role in changing oneâ€™s life.</p>

        <p class="last"> We all have friends but picking good friends is always a very difficult task. A best friend is someone with whom you feel comfortable and can easily share your thoughts and feelings. He or she is someone you trust and who trusts you in return. A best friend is someone who is there for you during good and bad times. Some common qualities that people tend to look for in a best friend include loyalty, trustworthiness, supportiveness, and fun-loving nature.</p>
